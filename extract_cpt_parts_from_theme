# The Historiador WordPress theme has some parts that are specific to
# Custom Post Types, which are registered separately.  This script
# removes those parts, placing them in a new directory.  The idea is to
# run this when we need to keep and/or repurpose the core code base.

# NOTE this is work in progress.  To get the code inside the theme's
# functions.php I have inserted two comments in the form of "{START,END}
# DO NOT EDIT".  We need to add a test that these actually exist and
# make sure any other errors are handled gracefully.

# Define the directories we will be using
historiador_theme_dir="$HOME/historiador-wp-theme-upstream"
historiador_extracted_parts_dir="$HOME/historiador-extracted-cpt-parts-templates"

# Clone the Historiador WP theme and place it in a new directory
echo "Preparing to clone upstream Historiador WP Theme"
echo "Will place it at $historiador_theme_dir"
echo ""
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/historiador/historiador-wp-theme.git "$historiador_theme_dir"

# Create the directory where we will be putting the CPT parts
mkdir -p "$historiador_extracted_parts_dir"
echo "Created the directory where we will place the extracted parts"
echo ""

### TODO turn the following two operations into a single function.  We
### need to re-use this code for more extractions.

# Operate on the functions.php. Currently (2018-12-01) this will extract
# the part of the function that registers a sidebar for each post type.
